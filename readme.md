The project is a web tool for academic students and researchers.
It is an explorer for different sort of documents that the user provides as sources for their research.
The explorer allows a preview of documents within an iframe, so their readability relies upon the browser. 
As a special feature, it provides a tool that renders the references section for an article to be submitted following the APA referencing style.

There is an SQL file that creates a db with some data for testing purposes.
As of now, the url sources that work are stored locally in my computer. To try out the visualisation, update the db data, field 'source' from table 'document' with the route to any sort of document stored in your computer. 
I have recently uploaded a bunch of documents to be visualised. Make sure you update the db with the URLs where you decide to store them.
